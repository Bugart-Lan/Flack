# Flask

Project 2 for Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is an online messaging service, where users are able to send and receive messeages in real time! Users can create channels (i.e. chatrooms) as well as join and see existing channels. Flask also features attaching files with your messages!

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the dependencies that you would need in order to run the web app. The `static` folder contains all the images and <strong>css</strong> and <strong>js</strong> files while the `templates` folder contains all the <strong>html</strong> files. `application.py` is the server part and `index.js` inside `static` is where all the amazing things happen in front end!
